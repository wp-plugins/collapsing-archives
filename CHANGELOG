Collapsing Archives Changelog

* 0.6.1:
    * Bug fix - fixed the previous year triangle pointing in the wrong 
      direction
    * Changed default options to reflect how I use it on my website

* 0.6: 
    * Changed name from Fancy Archives to Collapsing Archives
    * Changed author from Andrew Rader to Robert Felty
    * Added option to link to archives.php
    * Added option to list in chronological or reverse chronological order
    * Added triangles which mark the collapsing and expanding features
      That is, clicking on the triangle collapses or expands, while clicking
      on a month or year links to the archives for the said month or year
    * Changed behavior from starting all expanded and then collapsing on page
      load to the opposite
    * Removed the rel='hide' and rel='show' tags, because they are not xhtml
      1.0 compliant. Now uses the CSS classes instead
